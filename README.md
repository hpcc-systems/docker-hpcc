## How to use Docker HPCC image
You can start the Docker HPCC image in interactive (-i -t) or daemon mode (-d). You must start the HPCC processes then go to ECLWatch to submit jobs, query, and explore your data with the HPCC Systems platform.

To map a docker container port to a host port.

  "-p &lt;host port&gt;:&lt;docker container port&gt;"

The default ECLWatch port is 8010.

### Ubuntu
To start Docker in interactive mode and map ECLWatch port 8010 to host 8010:
```sh
sudo docker run -t -i -p 8010:8010 hpccsystems/hpcc /bin/bash
```

To start HPCC:
```sh
/etc/init.d/hpcc-init start
```

To start Docker in daemon mode and map ECLWatch port 8010 to host 8020:
```sh
sudo docker run -d -p 8020:8010  hpccsystems/hpcc
```


### CentOS
To start Docker in interactive mode and map ECLWatch port 8020 to host 8010:
```sh
sudo docker run -t -i --privileged -e "container=docker" -p 8020:8010 hpccsystems/hpcc:el7 /bin/bash
```

To start Docker in daemon mode and map ECLWatch port 8010 to host 8010:
```sh
sudo docker run -d --privileged -e "container=docker"-p 8010:8010 hpccsystems/hpcc:el7
```

## How to build Docker HPCC image
You can always create your own Dockerfile to build a Docker HPCC image. We provide some pre-defined Dockerfiles and tools here.
These are for the HPCC Platform for Ubuntu 16.04 and CentOS 7. HPCC Plugins for Dockerfiles to be provided later.

### Checkout this git reposiotry
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hpcc-systems/docker-hpcc.git
```
Currently there are two release versions: Gold Release: 6/ and Release Candidate: 6-rc/. There are two product types: platform and plugins.
There are two Linux distributions: Ubuntu (Ubuntu 16.04, default) and CentOS (CentOS 7)

### Update HPCC Platform Version
Make sure the HPCC Platform version is available in HPCCSystems.com -> "Download" -> "HPCC SYSTEM PLATFORM"
Update the version with update.sh. For example, if you want to build 6.4.14-1:
```sh
./update 6.4.18-1
```
### Build
You can go to the directory of interest which contains the Dockerfile to run the build, or you can run the test-build.sh script which includes test:
```sh
sudo ./test-build.sh -v 6 -l ubuntu -p platform
```
This will build HPCC Platform 6.x  for Ubuntu 16.04.

To upload a build image to Docker Hub:
```sh
docker push <repo>:<tag>  For example: docker push hpccsystems/hpcc:latest
```
